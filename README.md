# Capybara

Capybara is an Android App designed for learning language speaking. 

It uses srt/ass subtitle files and video files, to enable a imitation environment.
The snapshot following shows how it looks like.

When you click the subtitle, it will replay the corresponding sentence in the video.

To use it, install the app on your phone first, then create a fold in SD card 
root directory named "CPBRs", put the video file and srt file in it(they have to have
the same base name).
Now, open the app, and click the Floating Action Button(yellow one in the picture).
